            <p class="mb-2">I may collect the following types of information:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal Information you provide:</strong> When you use my contact forms, you may provide your name, email address, phone number, and the subject of your inquiry. If you use the Worldcoin contact form, you will provide your name, subject, and phone number.

                <li>
                    <strong>World ID Verification Data (Conceptual):</strong> If you interact with the "Sign in with World ID" feature, I conceptually receive a verification signal from Worldcoin (via a secure backend process not fully implemented on this frontend demo). No personal biometric data is collected by my application.
